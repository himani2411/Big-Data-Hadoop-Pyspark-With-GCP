## Big Data Pipeline

This project was an opportunity to practice what we have learned the class and combine it with our previous knowledge in a manner that suits our learning style and experience and to use our creativity.

Please go through the "Project Report.pdf" for the detialed steps that I have taken. 

 I have focused on analyzing the data to find the Top/Best Authors, Publishers, Books, etc. I have also tried to build a user-based recommendation system using PySpark. The recommendation system is an algorithm based on Machine Learning concepts which suggests relevant items based on the history of the user's usage.
I am using the Book-Crossing Dataset [1] which was mined and collated by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler and provided to us by Institut für Informatik. The data set contains approximately 279k users without their personal information but identified by a unique id (i.e User-ID). 


The dataset is provided as 3 CSV files


* BX-Users: Defines details of a User and contains its Demographic data
* BX-Books: Defines the Book entity, which is uniquely identified by ISBN number and
contains other information about books like the Title, author, Publisher, image URL’s, etc
* BX-Book-Ratings: Defines the ratings provided by the user to all the books it has
reviewed.

### Objectives
* Apply knowledge and skills learned in class
* Enhance learning by combining this class' content with knowledge from other data science courses or readings
* Improve written communication skills

### The data pipeline that I have followed
* Data Collection
* Data Storage
* Data Loading
* VPC Network
* Hadoop Cluster
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebook

### The tools I have used:
* Google Cloud Platform
* Python
* Pyspark and PYSpark SQL
* Google Cloud Storage
* Virtual Private Cloud
* DataProc Cluster
